            <p>I'm a water fanatic. I love water. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book.
            <br>
            <br>
            Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue There he comes. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Happy painting, God bless.
